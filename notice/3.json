But thanks to some long-standing myths and outdated advice, many of us end up wasting time, effort, and even money on things that simply don’t work. In this post, we’re clearing up the most common cleaning misconceptions so you can save time, avoid unnecessary hassle, and clean smarter — not harder.</p><h2>Vinegar Cleans Everything</h2><p>While vinegar is great on glass and some countertops, it’s not safe for natural stone, hardwood floors, or some sensitive appliances. It can dull finishes and even cause damage over time. Always check the surface carefully before you spray.</p><h2>More Product = Better Results</h2><p>Using more cleaner than recommended doesn’t make your surfaces cleaner — it often leaves residue, attracts more dust, or wastes valuable cleaning product. Follow the label carefully and let the cleaner do the work as intended.</p><h2>Bleach Cleans Everything</h2><p>Bleach disinfects, but it doesn’t actually remove dirt or grime. You still need a cleaner first to lift messes, then disinfect with bleach — and never mix it with other products!</p><h2>You Don’t Need to Clean If It Looks Clean</h2><p>Many high-touch areas (light switches, remotes, handles) look fine but harbor bacteria. Cleaning isn’t just about appearance — it’s about keeping your space healthy, too.</p><h2>Disinfecting and Cleaning Are the Same Thing</h2><p>They’re not! Cleaning removes dirt and debris, while disinfecting kills germs. You need both for a truly clean and safe space — especially in kitchens and bathrooms.</p><h2>Disinfecting and Cleaning Are the Same Thing</h2><p>They’re not!
